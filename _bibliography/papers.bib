	title = {A {Survey} of {Vectorization} {Methods} in {Topological} {Data} {Analysis}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09703},
	abstract = {Attempts to incorporate topological information in supervised learning tasks have resulted in the creation of several techniques for vectorizing persistent homology barcodes. In this paper, we study thirteen such methods. Besides describing an organizational framework for these methods, we comprehensively benchmark them against three well-known classification tasks. Surprisingly, we discover that the best-performing method is a simple vectorization, which consists only of a few elementary summary statistics. Finally, we provide a convenient web application which has been designed to facilitate exploration and experimentation with various vectorization methods.},

Mf is defined algebraically and is linear with respect to direct sums of morphisms. We study some interesting properties of Mf, and provide a way of obtaining Mf using matrix operations.}

  journal = {Annali di Matematica Pura ed Applicata (1923 -)},
  preview={f3.png},
  abstract = {Recently, trans-S-manifolds have been defined as a wide class of metric f-manifolds which includes, for instance, f-Kenmotsu manifolds, S-manifolds and C-manifolds and generalize well-studied trans-Sasakian manifolds. The definition of trans-S-manifolds is formulated using the covariant derivative of the tensor f and although this formulation coincides with the characterization of trans-Sasakian manifolds in such a particular case, this latter type of manifolds were not initially defined in this way but using the Gray-Hervella classification of almost Hermitian manifolds. The aim of this paper is to study how (almost) trans-S-manifolds relate with the Gray-Hervella classification and to establish both similarities and differences with the trans-Sasakian case.},

title={Stable Topological Summaries for Analyzing the Organization of Cells in a Packed Tissue}, 
volume={9},

doi={http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math9151723}, 
html = {https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/9/15/1723},
abstract = {We use topological data analysis tools for studying the inner organization of cells in segmented images of epithelial tissues. More specifically, for each segmented image, we compute different persistence barcodes, which codify the lifetime of homology classes (persistent homology) along different filtrations (increasing nested sequences of simplicial complexes) that are built from the regions representing the cells in the tissue. We use a complete and well-grounded set of numerical variables over those persistence barcodes, also known as topological summaries. A novel combination of normalization methods for both the set of input segmented images and the produced barcodes allows for the proven stability results for those variables with respect to small changes in the input, as well as invariance to image scale. Our study provides new insights to this problem, such as a possible novel indicator for the development of the drosophila wing disc tissue or the importance of centroids’ distribution to differentiate some tissues from their CVT-path counterpart (a mathematical model of epithelia based on Voronoi diagrams). We also show how the use of topological summaries may improve the classification accuracy of epithelial images using a Random Forest algorithm.},

abstract = {Persistent homology and persistent entropy have recently become useful tools for patter recognition. In this paper, we find requirements under which persistent entropy is stable to small perturbations in the input data and scale invariant. In addition, we describe two new stable summary functions combining persistent entropy and the Betti curve. Finally, we use the previously defined summary functions in a material classification task to show their usefulness in machine learning and pattern recognition.},
