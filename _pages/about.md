  I am a tenure-track faculty (profesor Ayudante doctor) in [Universidad de Sevilla](https://www.us.es/) and member of the research group [cimagroup](https://grupo.us.es/cimagroup/). My research interest are computational topology and its applications in a broad sense. I did my postdoc in the group of Herbert Edelsbrunner at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria](https://ista.ac.at/en/), and graduated as a PhD in mathematics at the [Instituto de Matemáticas de la Universidad de Sevilla](http://imus.us.es/www/?lang=GB) under the supervision of Rocío González-Díaz and María-José Jiménez.

  We are currently running a Computational Topology seminar at the University of Seville. The talks are hybrid, and everyone is welcome to join. The talks are in Spanish or English depending on the speaker preferences. Most of the talks can be found in our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e12fA5_9_2s&list=PLlxYJooSJFmkhAzNaXjV0ytk-WSiq9dzi). If you would like to receive an announcements for every talk, send an empty email to com-top_seminars-join(at)listasvol(dot)us(dot)es, and then reply—without changing anything—to the confirmation email that is sent. 

  You can find me in the office E1.63 in the Computer Science department of the Informatics Engenieering School, at Reina Mercedes campus.
