  I am a tenure-track faculty (profesor Ayudante doctor) in [Universidad de Sevilla](https://www.us.es/) and member of the research group [cimagroup](https://grupo.us.es/cimagroup/). My research interest are computational topology and its applications in a broad sense.

  I did my postdoc in the [group of Herbert Edelsbrunner](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/edelsbrunner-group/) at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, and graduated as a PhD in mathematics at the [Instituto de Matemáticas de la Universidad de Sevilla](http://imus.us.es/www/?lang=GB) under the supervision of Rocío González-Díaz and María-José Jiménez.

  You can find me in the office E1.63 in the Computer Science department of the Informatics Engenieering School, at Reina Mercedes campus.
