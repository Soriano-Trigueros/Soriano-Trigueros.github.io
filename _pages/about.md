  I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [group of Herbert Edelsbrunner](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/edelsbrunner-group/) at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria.
  My research interest are computational topology and topological data analysis (TDA).
  I have also worked in applications of TDA to biological tissues and machine learning.

  I have teaching experience in computer science and mathematics. 
  Most of the given modules where about the interplays between these two fields. 
  I am not giving any lectures at the moment.
  
  I received my PhD in mathematics at the [Universidad de Sevilla](http://imus.us.es/www/?lang=GB), under the supervision of Rocío González-Díaz and María-José Jiménez.

  You can find me in the office I01.03.071 (central building) am Campus 1, 3400 Klosterneuburg.
